  <p>
    I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UCSD. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am interested in the principles (and theories, if possible) of learning efficiency, especially data efficiency, as well as principle-guided efficient learning algorithms in realistic applications. I believe learning efficiency defines intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fun facts about me:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <!-- * My name in Chinese is 董(Dong, means supervise)城(Cheng, means city wall)昱(yu, means sunlight :sunny:). -->
    <li>My previous research focus was Physics and Astronomy, in particular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J4Gx9pvgqU">Solar System Dynamics</a>, that means the motion of any objects outside Earth and within our solar system (Yes, you are right! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem">The three-body problem</a>!)
    <li>Football (<a href="https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/football-or-soccer-name-game-explained/blt5502fa82bb1a4f17">or soccer?</a>) is my life. I play and watch games every week, rain or shine. DM me if you want to watch or play together! Football forever ⚽!
    <li>I love drama. I read (and hopefully also write in the near future) drama scripts. I also acted in stage plays. My favourite playwright is <a href="http://www.haroldpinter.org/home/index.shtml">Harold Pinter</a>.
